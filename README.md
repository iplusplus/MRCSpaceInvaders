MRCSpaceInvaders
================
This piece of work is based upon the incredible talk given by Mary Rose Cook (http://maryrosecook.com/) at Front Trends, where she live coded a game of space invaders from scratch.

I've added the following bits
- remove bodies from array that are outside y bounds. (with Ben Searle : https://github.com/bensearle).
- different sound effect
- reduced bullet volley size (down to one bullet per volley, but easilly variable)
- trigger bullet sound on first bullet only, irresepctive of volley size.
- added jumping and crude physics
- made bullet speed relative to jumping player
  ~ slow and fast bullets now possible!
